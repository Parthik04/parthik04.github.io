    <h2>About Our Group</h2>

    <div class="about-card">
      <p><strong>Who We Are:</strong><br>
        We are the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA)—a youth-led, student-powered
        alliance that brings together racialized high school students across New Brunswick to lead, connect, and create
        change.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-card">
      <p><strong>What We Do:</strong><br>
        We amplify underrepresented voices, advocate for equity in education, and build inclusive leadership
        opportunities. Through campaigns and student-led events, we create a strong and supportive community that stands
        for justice and belonging.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-card">
      <p><strong>Why We Exist:</strong><br>
        Because every student deserves to be heard, represented, and empowered. We believe that when racialized students
        lead, schools become more just, more vibrant, and more reflective of the world we want to build—together.
      </p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <div class="about-card">
      <p><strong>Our Identity:</strong><br>
        The NBHS-RSA is a student-led alliance united by a shared purpose: to uplift the voices and experiences of
        racialized high school students across the province. We are a space where identity is celebrated, leadership is
        cultivated, and change is driven by those most affected.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-card">
      <p><strong>Vision:</strong><br>
        We envision a New Brunswick where high school students of every background feel empowered to lead, confident in
        their voices, and fully represented in the decisions that shape their lives. A province where diversity isn’t
        just acknowledged, but embraced as essential to a just and thriving school culture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-card">
      <p><strong>Mission:</strong><br>
        Our mission is to center and elevate the lived experiences of racialized students by fostering inclusive
        leadership, creating safe spaces for dialogue and support, and driving systemic change through youth-led action.
        We believe in the power of community, collaboration, and courageous conversations to build a better future—starting
        in our schools.
