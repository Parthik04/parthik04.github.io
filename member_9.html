        <p><strong>Full Name:</strong> K’áe Kargegie</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Indigenous Students Representative</p>

            <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is K’áe Kargegie, my first name means "Willow" in my native language
                (Dene Kede)—a meaningful connection, as Willow is also my mom’s name. She is the most influential person
                in my life. I am from Inuvik and Délįnę North West Territories and moved to New Brunswick about a year
                and a half ago. This has really shown me how important Indigenous voices are, coming from a mostly
                Indigenous community to a place where it is not as clear. As an Indigenous woman (Inuit and Dene), I am
                extremely grateful to have been selected as the Indigenous Students Executive Representative.
            </p>

            <p>This role is immensely important to me because I have always been drawn to advocating for Indigenous
                voices. An example of this is when I spoke at the NWT Youth Parliament about the struggles with
                alcoholism and drug abuse in my community, which are some of the most evident effects of residential
                schools. With three of my grandparents having attended residential schools, and growing up in a town
                where the impacts were visible everywhere, I’ve seen firsthand how these schools have affected
                Indigenous peoples for many years. To this day, we continue to face endless traumas just because of who
                we are, and it’s because of this that I know I need to stand up for my people.
            </p>

            <p>I am super excited for this opportunity to bring a meaningful and indigenized perspective to this
                process, raise awareness about the realities of Indigenous Peoples, to advocate for all Indigenous
                Peoples in New Brunswick, and as well as everyone in my home community.
            </p>
