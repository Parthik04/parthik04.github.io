        <p><strong>Full Name:</strong> Elaha Sultan</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Events Coordinator</p>
        <p><strong>School & Grade:</strong> Moncton High School, Grade 11</p>

            <p><strong>About:</strong> Born and raised in Pakistan with Afghan roots, I bring a rich and diverse
                cultural perspective to my role as Event Coordinator for the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized
                Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA). My passion for leadership stems from a deep commitment to fostering
                inclusivity and celebrating diversity within school communities. As a henna artist, makeup artist, and
                hairstylist, I embrace creativity as a means of cultural expression and connection.</p>

            <p>Fluent in Urdu, Hindi, Dari, Persian, and English, I understand the power of communication in bridging
                cultural divides and promoting understanding. While I am not formally affiliated with any specific club,
                I actively participate in various school activities, reflecting my enthusiasm for collaboration and
                community engagement. My love for cooking and sharing meals with loved ones speaks to my belief in the
                simple yet meaningful ways we build connections.</p>

            <p>Through my work with NBHS-RSA, I aim to organize events that unite students, encourage dialogue, and
                celebrate the rich diversity that strengthens our communities. Leadership, to me, is not defined by
                titles or positionsâ€”it is about creating moments of connection that inspire and uplift others. By
                bringing people together, I hope to build an environment where every student feels valued, empowered,
                and proud of their identity.</p>
