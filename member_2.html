            <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is Zayed El Aaidy, and I am a grade 12 student at Moncton High School. I
                currently serve as the Vice President of the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance
                (NBHS-RSA) where I work to build an environment that includes and supports all high school students,
                regardless of their language, ethnicity, or background. Born and raised in the United Arab Emirates, and
                proud of my Moroccan roots, I grew up in a country where people from all over the world lived and worked
                together in tandem. Seeing that cultural unity molded my belief that unity is the cornerstone of a
                thriving society, and I am passionate about creating that exact sense of unity by using my voice to
                advocate for cultural representation and equity.
            </p>

            <p>Through my involvement in the student council of my school, I have gained firsthand experience in
                leadership, teamwork, and the dedication it takes to plan events. I also learned what it means to
                represent my fellow students, manage my responsibilities under pressure, and turn our ideas into
                meaningful actions that help our school community. Which is why the quote: “With great power, comes
                great responsibility.” is so important to me</p>

            <p>I joined the (NBHS-RSA) because I wanted to change the systems that prevent racialized students from
                truly reaching their full potential. Listening to their stories has deepened my resolve for advocacy. As
                the Vice President, I utilize my leadership experience to promote cultural representation and draw
                attention to the unique mental health challenges that are faced by the racialized youth. I aim to help
                lay the framework for the future of the Alliance by supporting our team and working closely with the
                President to make our vision a reality.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of the Alliance, I enjoy meeting new people and participating in activities and events that are
                fun and enjoyable. In my free time, you will often find me hanging out with friends, usually on some
                random side quest.
