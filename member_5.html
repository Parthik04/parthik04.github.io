            <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is Janvi Patel. I am a Grade 11 student at Moncton High School and
                currently serve as the Communications Director for the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student
                Alliance (NBHS-RSA). I believe in the power of communication to unite people, raise awareness, and
                foster inclusive spaces where every voice matters.</p>

            <p>I am originally from India and have had the privilege of experiencing diverse cultures—an experience that
                has instilled in me a deep commitment to equity, representation, and unity. In my role, I manage our
                social media presence and public relations, ensuring our messages align with our mission and values.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I support the creation of newsletters and announcements that keep our community informed
                and engaged. While I’m still developing my communication skills, I am passionate about growing and using
                my voice to make a positive difference. My experience includes event planning, teamwork, and thoughtful
                messaging with purpose and care.</p>

            <p>I joined NBHS-RSA to help dismantle barriers and advocate for students who deserve to feel seen,
                supported, and empowered. A quote that inspires me is: <em>“Change doesn’t start later—it starts
                    now.”</em> Outside of NBHS-RSA, I enjoy exploring new cultures, participating in the Multicultural
                Club, and spending quality time with loved ones.</p>
            <p>I will continue to do my best, and together, I believe we can build a stronger, more inclusive New
                Brunswick for everyone.
