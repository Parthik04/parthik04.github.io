            <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is Kamsiyochukwu Nelly Enwelumibeanu, mostly known as Nelly.E and I am
                the Diversity and Inclusion Officer for the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance
                (NBHS-RSA). I am a grade 11 student that attends Harrison Trimble High School. My role is to use my
                voice and leadership to advocate for any racialized youth and to help drive inclusion and diversity in
                every school in New Brunswick. With experience serving on multiple youth advisory committees, including
                the district’s youth advisory committee, Moncton’s youth advisory committee, and Pure Gold’s youth
                advisory committee.</p>


            <p>I am committed to being a voice for my peers and especially the ones who look more like me. I am
                passionate about eradicating racism and its inherent barriers. I share a huge love and appreciation for
                different cultures as I am from Nigeria, Igbo culture, a multicultural country. Through NBHS-RSA I aim
                to host a school wide events that invites people of all backgrounds to socialize and uplift one or
                another while incorporating safe space to converse about daily struggles and pressing issues. Outside
                the Alliance, I am involved at my school’s track and field team. I have a part-time job, and I’m
                involved with multiple youth advisory committees as listed previously above, and plan to join more. I am
                a dedicated member of my Christian family. I am in a Nigerian dance club that heavily performs for
                multiple events in the summer and I enjoy it. I like hanging out with friends and travelling to new
                places. I enjoy cooking, sewing and finding more ways to better myself and give to my community. I
                balance all of this while being an honours student in my school.
